# PyTorch From Scratch

This repository documents my PyTorch learning journey.

I am following the CampusX PyTorch playlist along with the
official PyTorch documentation, and implementing each concept
with small, clear, and runnable examples.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals before moving to
deep learning and GenAI projects.

The repository follows the order: PyTorch Tensors -> PyTorch AutoGrad ->
PyTorch Training Pipelines -> PyTorch NN Module -> DataSet And Dataloader Class -> 
Building First Simple ANN -> Neural Network Training On GPU -> Optimization Of NN
-> HyperParameter Tunning Of ANN -> Building A CNN -> Transfer Learning in Pytorch
-> RNN Using Pytorch -> Next Word Predictor (LSTM) Using Pytorch
