# PyTorch From Scratch

This repository documents my PyTorch learning journey.

I am following the CampusX PyTorch playlist along with the
official PyTorch documentation, and implementing each concept
with small, clear, and runnable examples.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals before moving to
deep learning and GenAI projects.
